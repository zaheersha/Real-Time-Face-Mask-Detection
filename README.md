# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection
This is a code for a real-time face mask detection system using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system detects faces in real-time using a webcam or any other camera connected to the computer, and then classifies each detected face as either "with mask" or "without mask".
